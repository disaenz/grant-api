# Grant API

Welcome to the **Grant API** ‚Äî a serverless, containerized REST API for managing grant-related operations, built with FastAPI and deployed to AWS Lambda using Docker and ECR. This project showcases modern Python backend practices, secure infrastructure-as-code, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Grant API provides a fast, serverless backend designed to be cost-efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain. It supports:

* **REST endpoints** for grant data operations (CRUD, querying, etc)
* **FastAPI** for type-safe, high-performance Python APIs
* **Database integration** (PostgreSQL, Neon, or any Postgres-compatible cloud DB)
* **CI/CD** with security scanning, automated ECR cleanup, and one-command Lambda deployment
* **Modern DevSecOps** practices: Docker, Trivy scanning, least-privilege IAM, IaC for ECR/Lambda roles

---

## üõ† Technologies

* **API Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
* **Containerization**: Docker, AWS ECR
* **Serverless Compute**: AWS Lambda (Container Image)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (via asyncpg + SQLAlchemy)
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
* **Security & Quality**: Trivy (image vulnerability scanning), IAM least-privilege policies
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (for ECR, Lambda, IAM roles/policies)

## üíª Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/disaenz/grant-api.git
   cd grant-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
(Recommended: use a Python virtual environment)

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.	**Run locally**

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

4.	**Test API endpoints**

    The interactive Swagger UI will auto-generate docs and let you test endpoints.

---

## üê≥ Docker Usage

1.	**Build Docker image**

    ```bash
    docker build -f Dockerfile.local -t grant-api:latest .
    ```

2.	**Run Docker container locally**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8080 grant-api:latest
    ```

---

## üîí Security & Quality

*	Trivy scans every Docker image for vulnerabilities during CI
*	IAM roles: Follows least-privilege for ECR push/pull and Lambda deploy
*	Terraform: All AWS infrastructure is managed as code

---

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes a complete GitHub Actions pipeline:
1.	Build & Push: Builds and pushes Docker images to AWS ECR
2.	Vulnerability Scan: Uses Trivy to check the image for CRITICAL vulnerabilities
3.	Cleanup: Automatically deletes old/dangling ECR images
4.	Deploy: Updates the AWS Lambda function with the new image

All sensitive values (ECR repo, image URI, AWS credentials) are stored as GitHub Secrets.

---

## üìù Deployment Notes
* Production deploys occur automatically on push to main.
* PRs/feature branches: Full build & scan runs, but deploy only happens on main.
